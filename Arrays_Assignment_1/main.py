
# ðŸ’¡ **Q1.** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order.

# **Example:**
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output0 [0,1]

# **Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]

# Answer :
def twoSum(nums, target):
    complementMap = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        complement = target - nums[i]
        if complement in complementMap:
            return [complementMap[complement], i]
        complementMap[nums[i]] = i
    return []

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

#  **Q2.** Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

# - Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# - Return k.

# **Example :**
# Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
# Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_*,_*]

# **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)

# Answer

# **Q4.** You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

# **Example 1:**
# Input: digits = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,4]

# Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
# Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

#  **Q5.** You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

# Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

# The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

# **Example 1:**
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

# **Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
# The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
